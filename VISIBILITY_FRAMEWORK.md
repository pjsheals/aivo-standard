# ðŸ“Š AIVO Visibility Framework  
**A Strategic Breakdown of the 9 Stages Mapped to the 6 Pillars of AIVO**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

The AIVO Standardâ„¢ operates across two key structural models:
- The **9-Stage Implementation Framework** (process-driven)
- The **6 Pillars of LLM Visibility** (principle-driven)

This document shows how these layers align to deliver full-spectrum visibility within LLM ecosystems like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, and Perplexity.

## ðŸ§± The 6 Pillars of AIVO (AI Visibility Optimization)

| Pillar                       | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| **1. Foundational Presence**        | Wikidata, Schema.org, structured data, factual anchors |
| **2. Knowledge & Mention Graphs**  | Directories like Crunchbase, G2, AlternativeTo, Product Hunt |
| **3. Prompt Relevance**            | Optimizing for common natural-language prompts and variations |
| **4. Content & Publishing**        | Trusted AI-ingestible platforms (Substack, GitHub, Medium) |
| **5. Submission & Indexing**       | Manual and automatic submission to AI indexing tools |
| **6. LLM Profile Building**        | Creation of Custom GPTs, Hugging Face Spaces, and more |

## ðŸš€ 9 Stages of the AIVO Standardâ„¢

| Stage | Name | Pillar Mapping |
|-------|------|----------------|
| 1     | Define Visibility Objectives & Prompts  | 3. Prompt Relevance |
| 2     | Establish Foundational Presence         | 1. Foundational Presence |
| 3     | Expand Knowledge & Mention Graphs       | 2. Knowledge & Mention Graphs |
| 4     | Ensure Prompt Discoverability           | 3. Prompt Relevance |
| 5     | Publish Trusted Content in AI Channels  | 4. Content & Publishing |
| 6     | Submit to LLM Indexing Tools            | 5. Submission & Indexing |
| 7     | Create AI Ecosystem Profiles            | 6. LLM Profile Building |
| 8     | Establish Trust Signals & Cross-Links   | 1, 2, 4 (hybrid) |
| 9     | Monitor, Iterate & Maintain Visibility  | All 6 pillars (iterative) |

## ðŸ§  Diagram Suggestion

> To visualize this:  
> Imagine a **horizontal ladder (9 stages)** with **6 vertical pillars** beneath, each supporting the process.  
> Every pillar touches at least one stage. Stage 9 sits atop all six.

## ðŸ“˜ Quick Glossary

- **CRU** = Citable Reference Unit (a factual item that LLMs can verify)
- **Prompt Layering** = Using multiple natural-language prompt types (e.g., short-tail, long-tail)
- **AIVO Compliance** = Conformance to all 9 stages with supporting documentation

## ðŸ§© Cross-Reference

- See [`CERTIFICATION.md`](CERTIFICATION.md) for how these mappings apply to audit & verification
- See [`PROMPTS.md`](PROMPTS.md) for real prompt examples used to test each visibility level
