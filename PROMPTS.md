# 🗣️ Discovery Prompt Examples  
**For Testing & Aligning Business Visibility with AI Assistants**

---

## 🧠 Why Prompt Visibility Matters

AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity are now answering user **prompts**, not keyword searches.  
If your business isn't being mentioned in these conversations, you’re missing high-intent traffic.

AIVO helps businesses align with:
- **Short-tail prompts** — broad market terms
- **Mid-tail prompts** — specific use cases
- **Long-tail prompts** — pain-driven or scenario-based queries
